# [Advent-Of-Code](https://adventofcode.com)

My solutions to the AOC puzzles. An ongoing project to learn different languages, concepts, algorithms, data structures and whatever else.

## Setup

Because of the many languages used, *rtx-cli* is used to install and use compilers and runtimes of different languages.

1. Install *rtx-cli*: `cargo install rtx-cli`. Follow the additional instructions to activate *rtx* in your shell.
2. Use `rtx install` when in the appropriate language directory.
3. Follow the individual README.md files in the language folders to install the required compilers and runtimes.

## Usage

Within the root workspace there is a number of pnpm scripts that will run things across all languages for you. See the [root package.json](./package.json).
